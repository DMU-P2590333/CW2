<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a student at De Montfort University in Leicester, I am currently studying Media Production. I grew up in a little village in the middle of nowhere,
  surrounded by fields. This sparked my love for nature and landscape photography at a very young age. My love for film and television started at
  a young age too, this was something that grew into a true passion of mine, it wasn't really until secondary school that I realised that I could work
  towards getting a career in the field. Throughout my educational career I have met some amazing teachers who helped me on my way, even believing in me
  when I couldn't believe in myself. I have taken many interests in the different paths available in the industry, I have written my own scripts, produced my
  own works, edited, directed and many other things. Being pushed to be a one man team to complete a production during my time at college definitely gave me
  some experience in each field.</p>
