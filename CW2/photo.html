  <h3>Missing Minds</h3>
<!--When including video or audio elements, it's a good idea, to include different
formats to reduce the chances of the users browers not supporting the media.-->
<div class="video"><video controls poster="img/poster.jpg">
  <source src="vid/missingminds.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="vid/missingminds.webm" type="video/webm">
    I'm sorry your browser does not support the video format,
            but you can watch the video <a href="vid/missingmind.mp4">Here</a>
</video></div>
<!--Small paragraphs of information on the piece was incuded using a <p> element-->
  <p>"Missing Minds" was a production piece I had to create during my time at sixthform,
  The piece had to be a minute long teaser trailer to one of our larger projects. It focused
  on the effects on cinematography than anything else. Not only was this my first production,
but I also produced it without any team, no camera or light operators, no editor. Everything was
done by me, with a strict time limit. I am proud of this piece because of that, regardless of the quality.</p>

<a href="write.html#dbi"><p>Unfornately, the original script for this production was lost. However here is the
  script for the short film that this trailer was promoting. Unfornately I was unable to
  produce the short due to the pandemic. Click here to see it.</p></a>

  <h3>Road Safety Animation (unfinished)</h3>
<div class="video"><video controls poster="img/animation.jpg">
  <source src="vid/animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="vid/animation.webm" type="video/webm">
</video></div>
  <p>This animation was due to another piece of coursework. However this was never finished due to
  finishing early. The animation was meant to be an education video for children teaching them about
road safety. This was the first time I ever attempted 3D animation.</p>

  <h3>Dead Mans Hate</h3>
  <div class="audio"><audio controls>
  <source src="aud/deadmanshate.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="aud/deadmanshate.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <p>Sorry, your browser does not support the audio files available,
              however you can download the mp3 version <a href="aud/deadmanshate.mp3">here</a></p></audio></div>

  <p>One of my first university assignments was to create a 2 minute audio piece telling a story of
  our choice, I decided to do a reading of "Dead Mans Hate" a poem written by Robert Ervin Howard. I added
the sound effects, which were a mix of sourced pieces and foley sounds I recorded myself. I then edited the piece to my standard
in Adobe Audition</p>
